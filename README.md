# desmosconsole
Things I commonly use while making a console script / desmos graph.
https://github.com/MathEnthusiast314/desmosconsole/blob/main/0_Calc.js, https://github.com/MathEnthusiast314/desmosconsole/blob/main/0_manipulate%20state.js are basic building blocks to get you started working in the desmos console and building scripts on/for the console or with tampermonkey.
